            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p><strong>Freedom Feeds</strong> is committed to supporting veterans and their families who are struggling
                with
                the challenges of everyday life due to the lasting effects of war. Whether facing the loss of a loved
                one,
                coping with severe mental health issues, or adjusting to life with a physical injury, <strong>many
                    veterans and
                    their families experience immense hardship.</strong></p>
            <p>We provide <b>essential food donations</b>, ensuring that no veteran or their family goes hungry. Beyond
                meals,
                we offer practical assistance, helping to ease financial strain and improve overall well-being. Our
                mission is
                to stand by those who have served, offering the <strong>respect, care, and support</strong> they deserve
                in
                their time of need.</p>

                <h2>Sophie's Story</h2>
                <p><strong>Sophie’s life changed forever</strong> when her husband, a dedicated serviceman, returned
                    home from
                    deployment. The man she loved had <strong>endured the unimaginable</strong>, and the weight of war
                    left deep
                    scars—ones that couldn’t be seen but were <strong>impossible to ignore.</strong> His struggle with
                    severe
                    mental health challenges meant that Sophie not only became his carer but also the <strong>sole
                        provider for
                        their two young children.</strong></p>

                <p>Some days were harder than others. Between hospital visits, therapy sessions, and trying to
                    <strong>maintain
                        a sense of normality for her children,</strong> Sophie often found herself overwhelmed.
                    Financial struggles
                    added another layer of stress—balancing rent, energy bills, school supplies, and <strong>basic
                        necessities
                        felt like an uphill battle.</strong></p>

                <p>That’s when <strong>Freedom Feeds</strong> stepped in. Through food packages and essential grants,
                    the
                    organisation ensured that Sophie’s family <strong>never had to worry about their next meal</strong>
                    or keeping
                    their home warm during winter. It wasn’t just about financial support—it was about <strong>dignity,
                        relief,
                        and knowing that someone cared.</strong></p>

                <p>Thanks to <strong>Freedom Feeds</strong>, Sophie’s family has regained a sense of stability.
                    <strong>While
                        the challenges remain, they no longer have to face them alone.</strong></p>
