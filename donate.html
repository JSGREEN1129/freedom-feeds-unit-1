            <h2>Ways to Support and Donate</h2>
            <p>There are many ways you can help <strong>Freedom Feeds support veterans and their families.</strong>
                Donations of food,
                money, and clothing all make a <strong>meaningful impact,</strong> ensuring that those in need receive
                <strong>essential supplies
                    and assistance.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>You can also <strong>volunteer your time</strong> to help with food distribution, fundraising, or
                outreach efforts. Every
                contribution, big or small, helps us provide <strong>vital support to veterans facing hardship.</strong>
                Together, we can
                make a real difference in the lives of those who have <strong>served us to protect our
                    freedoms.</strong></p>
