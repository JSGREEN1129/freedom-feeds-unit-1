            <h2>Ways to Support and Donate</h2>
            <p>There are many ways you can help Freedom Feeds support veterans and their families. Donations of food,
                money, and clothing all make a meaningful impact, ensuring that those in need receive essential supplies
                and assistance.</p>

            <p>You can also volunteer your time to help with food distribution, fundraising, or outreach efforts. Every
                contribution, big or small, helps us provide vital support to veterans facing hardship. Together, we can
                make a real difference in the lives of those who have served us to protect our freedoms.</p>
